- Migrate status message to use position target and point types
- Update readme and documentation
- Rethink move oriented with obstacle avoidance pipeline
- Kp a bit too high for z velocity in OA?
- How should timeouts affect operations? Maybe if the operation times out, we should stop in the midst of the operation and got to the steady state.
- init, check if we got local pose.
- If we land at a position and then move again the drone will jump, fix this, has probably something to do with steady states.
