- Should move to a more generalized state machine perspective, because the logic between states are performed on the client side now. The client should only have to specify to land, take off, move or follow, and the fsm should find the different states which make up that generalized operation. 
- In operation client, restructure the functions to be specific to the actions. So requestTakeOff, requestLand etc. so the parameters make more sense. 
- Migrate status message to use position target and point types
- Update readme
- Move move radius completion constants and such to core (as well as take off height)
- Rethink move oriented with obstacle avoidance pipeline
